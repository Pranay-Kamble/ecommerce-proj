In modern backend software engineering—particularly within Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture—these four folders represent a standard structural approach designed to separate concerns, improve testability, and decouple business logic from technical infrastructure. [1, 2, 3]
Here is a breakdown of what each folder typically contains and handles:
1. Domain Folder
This is the core of the application, often called the "Domain Model." It contains the business logic, rules, and data structures that define the problem space.

• Contents: Entities (user, product), Value Objects, Domain Events, and interfaces for Repositories.
• Responsibility: Defines what the application does, not how it does it. It should have zero dependencies on frameworks, databases, or external APIs. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

2. Handler Folder (or Controller)
The Handler acts as the entry point of the API, dealing with external requests. In many implementations, these are referred to as Controllers.

• Contents: HTTP handlers, REST controllers, API routing, and input validation.
• Responsibility: Receives input (e.g., JSON request), parses it, calls the appropriate Service, and maps the results to an HTTP response. [1, 17, 18, 19, 20]

3. Service Folder
The Service layer handles orchestration and application-specific business logic. It sits between the Handler and the Repository.

• Contents: Use Case handlers (e.g., , ), application orchestration logic.
• Responsibility: Orchestrates flow, manages transactions, and coordinates multiple repositories. It ensures that the business rules from the domain are correctly applied. [1, 9, 23, 24, 25]

4. Repository Folder
The Repository layer acts as a mediator between the domain and data-mapping layers, abstracting data access.

• Contents: Implementation of database queries (SQL, Mongo, Redis), ORM models, and data mappers.
• Responsibility: Manages data persistence (saving, updating, fetching). It hides the details of the database from the rest of the application, making it easier to switch from SQL to NoSQL, for example. [2, 26, 27, 28, 29]


Summary of Data Flow (Example: Creating a User)
1. Request hits the Handler.
2. Handler parses the input and calls UserService (Service).
3. Service applies business rules, creates a Domain object, and calls UserRepository (Repository).
4. Repository saves the data to the Database.

Comparison of Responsibilities

| Folder [33, 34, 35] | Responsibility | Focus  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | Business Logic & Rules | The "What" (Business Model)  |
| Handler | Request Parsing & Response | The "Entrance" (API/CLI)  |
| Service | Orchestration & Use Cases | The "Glue" (Workflow)  |
| Repository | Data Persistence & Queries | The "How" (Database/Storage)  |


This structure is highly popular in Go, Java (Spring), and TypeScript applications to prevent "fat" controllers and maintain clean, testable code. [9, 36, 37, 38, 39]
